# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Guide for e-Traffic Backend

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- GitHub account
- Railway account (free at railway.app)

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Install Railway CLI
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### 2. Login to Railway
```bash

- Choose "Create a new project"
- Name: "e-traffic-backend"
- Select your GitHub repository

### 5. Add MySQL Database
```bash
railway add
```
- Select "MySQL" from the list
- This creates a MySQL service

### 6. Set Environment Variables
```bash
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set JWT_SECRET=e_traffic_super_secret_key_2024_change_this_in_production
railway variables set CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.vercel.app
```

### 7. Deploy
```bash
railway up
```

### 8. Get Your Backend URL
```bash
railway status
```
- Copy the URL (e.g., https://your-app.railway.app)

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Check if MySQL service is running
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs`

### CORS Issues
- Update CORS_ORIGIN with your actual frontend domain
- Ensure frontend is deployed first

### Build Failures
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
- Verify package.json has correct start script
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
